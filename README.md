## Description
This project is a compilation of another projects. I decided to gather here five of my small projects in one place. The entire project can be regroup or used whole in another project. All parts and elements have a transparent background. The background showing the endless office corridor with a glass transparency. In order to put in the light and to promote the design and visual part of my project at first I used some dummy text as a placeholder. It helps people to focus on the actual layout and color styling of my desgn work. The project consists of the following smaller projects:

* Alarm application, 
* Contact form, 
* Table,
* Calculator,
* Footer contact form.

NB!: Content some dummy "Lorem Ipsum" text.
